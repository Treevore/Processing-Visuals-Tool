Processing Visuals Tool

The whole thing started with one audio visualizer and grew from there. I wanted it to be easy for people to play around with the visuals, so I added an interface. The only external library used is Minim, for the audio analyzing.

The code grew and changed with me learning new things about processing (as in functions, classes, etc).

Controls:
generally the interface is controlled via mouse, you can scroll through the interface items with your mousewheel

p - pause/play demo song
spacebar - freeze current frame
